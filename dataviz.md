In the spirit of Dieter Rams's 10 Principles of good design here is a list of 5 principles of good data visualization. The tenets below are derived from the research of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com) and [Stephen Few](https://www.perceptualedge.com).

**1. Good data visualization is informative**

Well presented data forms the backbone of a compelling story. It has the power to strengthen and illuminate a narrative—improving understanding and focusing on what's important.

**2. Good data visualization is well designed**

Communicating quantitative data effectively requires the right balance of components. Color is used with purpose and is not distracting. All parts are labeled and include a legend when necessary. The scale of the visualization must be immediately identifiable. The standard lexicon of graphs are often all that is required—do not use pie charts.

**3. Good data visualization is equally concerned with what is not shown**

People are easily overwhelmed with extraneous details. Simplify and reduce what is being presented to its' essential components.

**4. Good data visualization is created with pure data**

Avoid muddy and incomplete sources of data. Misleading the audience with false information or lack of clarity is a cardinal sin. Ultimately, good data visualization enables better decisions and actions.

**5. Good data visualization is human**

Parsing large data quantities of data is beyond human perception. The goal with any kind of data visualization is to augment and improve human perception. Just like a microscope it allows us to explore data within the realm of our understanding.
