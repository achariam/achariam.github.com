## A Eulogy For My Father

> I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul

This is the final line of [Invictus](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus), a poem by William Ernest Henley, that helped comfort Nelson Mandela as he faced unfair imprisonment in South Africa. I have been ruminating on these words as it captures the very same spirit my father carried to his very last day for us—strength.

My dad[^1] led our small family through many hills and valleys over his lifetime and all through it we never felt a limit to his love for us. In fact, he had so much love to give that he readily shared it with those around him as well.

While I know it's impossible to sum a special life in a few paragraphs, I thought I'd share a few vignettes that hopefully represents the kind of man he aspired to be and ultimately was.

He was born into a big family, one of seven brothers and sisters, in a small town in the far corners of Malaysia. Growing up, he especially adored his mother, a gentle wartime nurse, but always aspired to be like his father, a well respected man in the community. My grandfather first worked as a court interpreter who spoke over seven languages and finally became a leader in the church as the first Tamil Lutheran reverend in Kuala Lumpur.

While he could have easily followed a similar path of his role model parents, he wanted to figure out how to do it his own way—and he sure did. Growing up in the 1940's as a rambunctious middle kid surrounded with a healthy dose of western films, James Dean, and equally lively siblings he managed to develop a strong sense of wonder, playful mischief and above all wanderlust.

To quell this fire in the next chapter of his life, he set out traveling across the world. He spent his 20's covering most of the major continents as a student backpacker going as far as Istanbul to Copenhagen. He finally settled down, living several years in London and then Germany and became so fluent in German that he was able to work as a tour guide while studying.

By now, he had spent years building a promising life for himself abroad but gave it all up the moment he got a letter from his mom saying that his father's health had taken a turn for the worse. His main driving force of putting family above everything else kicked in; he sold all his worldly possessions and immediately returned home on the next flight.

He then spent the next few years helping his family all while trying to rebuild a life for himself back in Malaysia. He accomplished many things from being a radio engineer, tour guide, and even a successful artist. He eventually found a career working in the hotel industry doing what he did best, connecting with people. He rose through the ranks becoming a great executive, orchestrating million dollar events at some of the most beautiful hotels in Malaysia. While doing all of this he also struck gold by discovering his lifelong companion, my mother.

You may have noticed a shared thread here, from hearing about his life so far. No matter what happened he was always building relationships with people and he was incredibly gifted at it—instantly connecting with people of all walks of life. Growing up with him I would always be witness as he would somehow get strangers talking about their biggest dreams and sharing the burden of their deepest worries with him.

Now I realize, his secret was that he genuinely cared. Not only did he care he also managed to stir up greatness within those he met. I heard firsthand how so many of his nephews and nieces, who achieved great success, got their dream careers because he helped them believe in themselves. He had this sure fire way of convincing you, you could do anything even if you didn't at first believe it yourself. He did the same and much more for me. He was always up for anything, whether it was driving around town trying to find an obscure computer part I needed or encouraging me to read by waking up before dawn to wait in line together for the next Harry Potter book.

As this theme of always connecting with others swelled throughout his life, he finally coupled it with the mission and calling that he so greatly admired in his father. He first started studying theology as a lay preacher in Malaysia and finally completed seminary being ordained here in the United States. It was one of his proudest moments, not because of what he had achieved but because it was one of the closest ways he could connect with my late grandfather.

He seemingly intertwined all his dreams in what came next when we moved here from Malaysia. Having lived abroad he always realized that the education system back home was not the best so he tried desperately hard, along with my mother, to get my sister and I to better opportunities. Together the both of them sacrificed everything they had to bring us here.

It was tough packing up your entire life and giving up everything and everyone you knew in the hopes of a better future. But my dad knew it was possible, he had done it before and had to do it again. So we sold all our worldly possessions and came here.

In our first interview with the American consulate he was so proud when the immigration officer asked, "Why has a well traveled cosmopolitan like yourself not been to America yet?" as he approved our visa. I still recall the sheer joy I saw on his face later in the car ride home. So to New York City we went, equal parts afraid and excited for what was next.

Things turned difficult again as we struggled to figure out how to find our footing in our new home. But a beautiful thing happened—he trusted that he would find people to help, and his trust wasn't misplaced as more help came than he had ever hoped. Slowly but surely, we built a bigger family here and received more love than we could ever imagine. And to all of your beautiful faces who are gathered here today, thank you[^2]. If I could spend all the time I have thanking each of you I would. You helped him and us make true a dream of having a better life. We are immensely lucky.

But like everyone, my dad battled with his own personal challenges. As a proud man he could be difficult but in the end no matter what he would be the first to try and make amends. He would forget anger easily and he always returned back with an abundance of love regardless of who was in the wrong. His love for family and God were his pillars. He served God, relied on the uncompromising companionship of my mother, and loved, inspired and fought for us with everything he had and then some.

But I'd be remiss not to mention his other pillar, my father loved good food. Raised in a an era of Asian history where food was scarce—sharing it was the highest honor you can afford a stranger or friend. The first thing he would always ask is if you had eaten and was quick to offer food or a restaurant that you could visit together. As things started getting rough over the past few years, it was one of the few things left he really could enjoy unencumbered. He was suffering so much as cruel diseases robbed him first of his mobility and then his overall health—so having a meal that reminded him of his homeland or mother's cooking meant so very much.

Saving the best for last the most I learned about this man was from the great fortune of having him as a father. From tickle fights to bringing me surprise lunches at school in the middle of his busy workday. Or sleeping by our bedside in the hospital when we were sick. He always always put family first. My mother and sister have countless of stories just like these about him. Like when he devoted himself to taking care of his bed ridden mother-in-law till her last days to fretting around the house afraid my sister might be being attacked by a bear at her first sleep away camp.

One of my most cherished memories of him come from spontaneous short weekend trips we used to take as a family every now and then. These vacations often involved him stirring me awake an hour before sunrise to walk along the beach. I'd wake up a little grumpy but he'd be patient as we tried to get ready without turning the lights on so we might not disturb my baby sister and mother as they rested. On these walks we would collect sea shells and he would teach me all manner of life lessons while we waited for dawn on another tropical day. I had the privilege to watch some of the most beautiful sunrises with him. He always knew how to cultivate whimsy and wonder with beautifully simple moments like these.

Towards the end I felt really selfish, I wanted more of this great man in my life as I very reluctantly realized I might not have him around much longer. So I asked him to fight hard and he did because I asked. He was deeply tired and ready to find relief from his suffering but he stood up and walked fighting for us with his last breath on that Friday morning till he couldn't any more.

*He was the master of his fate, and captain of his soul. Thank you Papa.*
