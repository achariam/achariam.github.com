		<div class="seven columns">
			<p>Almost two years ago, Yorgo filled me in on an ambitious plan for his latest installation. It was an intriguing idea that drew inspiration from a scandal that occured in the 90’s. If you are curious, Yorgo discusses his motivations in a recent <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Yorgo-Alexopoulos-Clouds-servers-fakes-6128415.php">interview with SF Gate</a>.</p>

			<p>Right from the start we knew it was going to be a complex build requiring a combination of skills across many different disciplines. I was tasked with finding the tools and materials to make this sculpture a reality.</p>

			<p>After he presented me with his early sketches I proceeded to make a CAD mockup so we could 3D print and experiment with the form of the sculpture iteratively. We built most of the three final scultpures in-house while relying on metal fabricators for the frame.</p>

			<figcaption>Various stages of the build process.</figcaption>

			<p>Once the main structure was in place, there was the task of writing all the custom code to make the server come to life. I worked closely with Yorgo to dial in and create the exact look and feel for the project he was looking for.</p>

			<p>This piece was one of the most technically and physically rewarding projects I’ve worked on as it perfectly lies at the intersection of art and technology.</p>

			<p>Due to the proprietary nature of this build, I cannot share too many of the details. However, if you would like to read an in-depth article on the basic process, I recently put together a <a href="http://www.achariam.com/prototyping">comprehensive overview on hardware prototyping</a>.</p>

			<p>2014 - 2015</p>

		<div class="four columns">
			<p><a href="https://www.designernews.co">Designer News</a> was conceived as a side project of the now defunct LayerVault. The founders decided to create this community as a platform to share news about their own product and interesting news within the design industry.</p>

			<p>As it gained traction I was hired to lead the project. I had the right combination of product design, management and editorial skills required.</p>

			<p>As the person solely responsible for Designer News within the company, I was required to wear many hats. I never had a typical work day.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="four columns">
			<p>The sum total of my efforts could be realized by several key metrics. When I started, the readership was in the thousands.</p>

			<p class="emphasis">At the end of my first year, we were at several hundred thousand readers and driving several million clicks a month. 75% of DN readers visit the site every day.</p>

			<p>After <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/11/dropboxs-acquisition-of-pixelapse-is-not-enough-to-save-competitor-layervault-from-closing/">LayerVault was shutdown</a>, I remained on as an advisor. Designer News has a new home at <a href="http://www.metalab.co">Metalab</a> where it continues to grow.</p>

			<p>In addition to running Designer News, I would often be tasked with work for LayerVault as well. This involved designing and creating product materials, guidelines, internal tools and helping create several new product features. Below is a list that highlights some of the major things I worked on for both DN and LayerVault:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Helped build and design various user and admin features for DN. That included voting ring detection, IP black listing, reply notifications, the weekly DN digest, admin dashboard & controls and several others.</li>
				<li>Built an internal design related curation app using the twitter API.</li>
				<li>Organized <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/41377-request-for-amas">AMAs</a> with folks like <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/38716-ama-im-john-maeda-design-partner--kleiner-perkins-caufield--byers-kpcb-in-silicon-valley">John Maeda</a>, <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/37106-ama-im-julie-zhuo-director-of-product-design--facebook">Julie Zhuo</a>, <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/23277-ama-jessica-hische">Jessica Hische</a>, <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/45342">Matias Duarte</a> among many others.</li>
				<li>Coordinated community meetups & contests throughout the US.</li>
				<li>Designed relevant ad campaigns for both Designer News and LayerVault.</li>
