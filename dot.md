## The Red Dot

We got our first glimpse at the latest design of the Apple Watch more than two years ago[footnote to red edition series 1 watch]. No less, adorned on the wrist of Tim Cook was a stainless steel model with a bright red crown cap. Until last week, I wholly forgot about this photo—chalking it up to the whimsy of CEO with unlimited resources.

I was immediately fascinated by this small but obvious aesthetic revision. I quickly realized, in this case form didn't follow function. The more expensive steel and edition watches have always had this cap while the cheaper aluminum models did not. It was flourish solely in place to signify differentiation.

The design language of ornamentation is one the pillars of the luxury industry. The utility of a certain object doesn't necessarily increase with price. A diamond encrusted sapphire vessel doesn't carry liquid better than a plastic water bottle.

To understand the rational of this decision we turn towards the tightly nit worlds of fashion and horology.

The most visible aesthetic design revision to the upcoming Apple  Watch is the bold red crown cap. My interest piqued as we unofficially learned through leaks and then officially shortly after at the Apple Keynote. As a designer this and not the notch struck me as the most interesting design decision that warranted  a story.

I had an immediate reaction to it. We all react differently to change, most of the time negatively. I had a growing sense of curiosity as to what informed this decision.

Colors used to signal and brand are not new, in fashion or horology. It's not even new to the Apple Watch. The first batch Edition series watches featured different colored crowns, which was dropped in the following years ceramic edition models.

Unbeknownst to us at the time, Tim Cook was spotted almost two years ago wearing a stainless steel Apple Watch with a red crown.

From a design perspective it really stands out. All the LTE models have the red crown cap. The answer lies at the center the world of horology and fashion. When entering a new product category Apple always spends an inordinate amount of time understanding the domain it is entering. Jony's Ive is known for being [obsessive](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/the-apple-watch/). This leads to a deep homage and respect of the field Apple entered. It demonstrates care and respect to the thing they're making and the history. The thing is with fashion, form is function. Color is used to signal exclusivity, tell a story, create a brand. The crown is just that, a marker that has been employed. I struggled to find a functional reason but couldn't come up with one. Previously the aluminum models didn't even have a cap which drives the conclusion that this purely an indicator. But it is inline with the world of fashion and horology.

I was able to find several notable examples. Leica cameras have carried the distinct red mark since it's inception in 1XXX. All Christian Louboutin shoes have red soles.

Symbols like this permeate through pop culture really quickly. Bodak Yellow has this [quote](https://genius.com/12365695)

Watchmakers continuously release and make watches with specific color accents to signify various editions. In another nod to Marc Newson's famous Ikepod which inspired the original watch and now famous Ive/Apple collaborator. Another watch designed by Newson in 1998, the hemipode, features red accented secondary buttons.

Even Dieter Rams uses distinct colors to bring your attention towards key features and indicators in many of his industrial designs.

One other argument could be made for the symbolism of the red dot. It carries cultural weight across. From the Japanese flag to HAL.

In software design, the red dot is simply used to call your attention. This might be the most obvious answer. It's bothered some people so much, there are already companies popping overnight offering stickers to cover the up the crown cap.

At the end of the day these ideas might be pure conjecture and the simple answer could be it's a red dot because you want people to know you have the latest and shiniest gizmo on your wrist. A status symbol.
